## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose

> Identify the purpose of this SDD and its intended audience. (e.g. “This software
> design document describes the architecture and system design of XX. ….”).

### 1.2 Scope

> Provide a description and scope of the software and explain the goals, objectives and
> benefits of your project. This will provide the basis for the brief description of your
> product.

### 1.3 Overview

> Provide an overview of this document and its organization.

### 1.4 Reference Material

> List any documents, if any, which were used as sources of information for the test plan.

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

> Provide definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations that might exist to
> properly interpret the SDD. These definitions should be items used in the SDD that
> are most likely not known to the audience.

## 2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

> Give a general description of the functionality, context and design of your project.
> Provide any background information if necessary.

## 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 Architectural Design

> Develop a modular program structure and explain the relationships between the
> modules to achieve the complete functionality of the system. This is a high level
> overview of how responsibilities of the system were partitioned and then assigned to
> subsystems. Identify each high level subsystem and the roles or responsibilities
> assigned to it. Describe how these subsystems collaborate with each other in order to
> achieve the desired functionality. Don’t go into too much detail about the individual
> subsystems. The main purpose is to gain a general understanding of how and why
> the system was decomposed, and how the individual parts work together. Provide a
> diagram showing the major subsystems and data repositories and their
> interconnections. Describe the diagram if required.

### 3.2 Decomposition Description

> Provide a decomposition of the subsystems in the architectural design. Supplement
> with text as needed. You may choose to give a functional description or an object
> oriented description.

> For a functional description, put top level data flow diagram (DFD) and structural
> decomposition diagrams.

> For an OO description, put subsystem model, object diagrams, generalization
> hierarchy diagram(s) (if any), aggregation hierarchy diagram(s) (if any), interface
> specifications, and sequence diagrams here.

### 3.3 Design Rationale

Discuss the rationale for selecting the architecture described in 3.1 including critical
issues and trade/offs that was considered. You may discuss other architectures that
were considered, provided that you explain why you didn’t choose them.

## 4. DATA DESIGN

### 4.1 Data Description

> Explain how the information domain of your system is transformed into data
> structures. Describe how the major data or system entities are stored, processed and
> organized. List any databases or data storage items.

### 4.2 Data Dictionary

> Alphabetically list the system entities or major data along with their types and
> descriptions. If you provided a functional description in Section 3.2, list all the
> functions and function parameters. If you provided an OO description, list the objects
> and its attributes, methods and method parameters.

## 5. COMPONENT DESIGN

> In this section, we take a closer look at what each component does in a more
> systematic way. If you gave a functional description in section 3.2, provide a
> summary of your algorithm for each function listed in 3.2 in procedural description
> language (PDL) or pseudo code. If you gave an OO description, summarize each
> object member function for all the objects listed in 3.2 in PDL or pseudocode.

> Describe any local data when necessary.

## 6. HUMAN INTERFACE DESIGN

### 6.1 Overview of User Interface

> Describe the functionality of the system from the user’s perspective. Explain how the
> user will be able to use your system to complete all the expected features and the
> feedback information that will be displayed for the user.

### 6.2 Screen Images

> Display screenshots showing the interface from the user’s perspective. These can be
> handdrawn or you can use an automated drawing tool. Just make them as accurate
> as possible. (Graph paper works well.)

### 6.3 Screen Objects and Actions

> A discussion of screen objects and actions associated with those objects.

## 7. REQUIREMENTS MATRIX

> Provide a crossreference that traces components and data structures to the
> requirements in your SRS document.
> Use a tabular format to show which system components satisfy each of the functional
> requirements from the SRS. Refer to the functional requirements by the
> numbers/codes that you gave them in the SRS.

## 8. APPENDICES

> Appendices may be included, either directly or by reference, to provide supporting details
> that could aid in the understanding of the Software Design Document.
