# Next.js Manual
> Created 12-4-2023

Open in an integrated terminal the Next App by accessing the root project folder. The folder should have a package.json file as well as some additional folders like `public` and `src`.

Run the app in dev mode by entering the following command:
`npm run dev`.

The `src` folder should contain the `app` directory which serves as the router for the application. Note that the `page.tsx` file within this directory serves as the Home page for the software; and any other pages should be stored within their matching end-point directories. The `layout.tsx` file serves as the default layout most pages will have and thus might have a component for a Navbar and a footer.
